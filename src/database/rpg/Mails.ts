In order to make the RPG more balanced, we decided to nerf stamina & health for everyone. Before, your stamina & health were depending 30% on your level 70% on your skill points (the % are not accurate, just an estimation).
Now, it mostly depends on the amount of skill points you've put.
Everytime you level up, you will get +2 health.
Your stamina will 100% depend on your skill points (stamina skill tree).

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the [support server](https://discord.gg/jolyne).`,
